## How It Works

1. **User Input:** Students enter a topic they wish to learn about.
2. **Video Generation:** The model generates a relevant video using AI, allowing students to visualize the topic.
3. **Text Summarization:** Students can paste a transcript or relevant text, which is then summarized for easier understanding.
4. **Question Generation:** Based on the summary, the application generates assignment questions for self-assessment.
5. **Performance Analysis:** After students answer the questions, the system analyzes their responses, identifying strong and weak areas.
6. **Personalized Recommendations:** The application offers tailored resources and additional videos to help improve understanding in weaker sections.

### Example Workflow

- A student enters "Machine Learning" as a topic.
- The application generates a video about machine learning principles.
- The student pastes the transcript of the video and receives a summarized version.
- The model generates a set of questions related to the summarized text.
- After answering the questions, the model evaluates their performance and suggests additional resources for improvement.

## Technologies Used
